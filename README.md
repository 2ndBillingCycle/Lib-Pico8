# Lib-Pico8
A Pico-8 library of useful common functions.

It should be noted that as of April 11 2016, the library has just been published rather hastily. A lot of the code has not yet been refined or even tested, so use at your own risk. Contributions are very welcome and highly encouraged. Full documentation coming soon!
